This is my implementation of the RMU Entrance Exam #1.

I've added some stats gathering and the ability to run
unit tests or the memory test across multiple Rubies (see
the multi_rubies script for details). You can see my
graph of stats [here](http://jacaetevha.github.com/rmu_exam_1/).

Refer to the rmu_entrance_exam.pdf for more information.
